# PitchPerfect
Udacity iOS Nanodegree Project

PitchPerfect is a simple AVFoundation iPhone app that allows users to record an audio using their microphone and then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. The user can also speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

### Implementation
- PitchPerfect demonstrates a simple example of MVC (Model-View-Controller) design principles.
- The App navigates between two scenes in the app using `UINavigationController`
- The app successfully uses `AVAudioRecorder` to record audio.
- The app uses the delegate pattern and implements the `audioRecorderDidFinishRecording()` method.
- The app does not use a Storyboard segue hardcoded to the `Stop` button. A segue from the first scene to the second is programmatically triggered via `performSegueWithIdentifier()`.
- Plays audio files using `AVFoundation`â€™s `AVAudioEngine` class
